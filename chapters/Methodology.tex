A finite element model is used to represent a area(2D) of an intragranular space. The 2D mesh is created using Trimesh. Two material objects are created, one being U-10Mo and another one is Xenon. Thermal conductivity of U-10Mo is used from Burkes et. al~\cite{burkes2010thermo}. Different set of thermal conductivity of Xenon is used. The effective thermal conductivity of
